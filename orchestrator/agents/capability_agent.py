"""
CapabilityAgent — answers CAPABILITY and off-ontology (OTHER) queries.

TTL-first, SINGLE path (TODO-012). Capabilities are ``ontosage:Amenity`` /
``ontosage:KnowledgeTopic`` TRIPLES in the building's ontology — authored via the admin
Capabilities GUI (``/api/v1/admin/capabilities``) or by writing the OCBV TBox terms
(``input/ontosage_schema.ttl``) — and answered by the CapabilityGraphResolver. Genuinely
uploaded manuals/policies live in the per-building document KB (``documents_<bldg>``).
There is no ``capability.yaml`` and no Qdrant capability-KB anymore — both were removed.

Answer chain — each source is independent and OPTIONAL; NONE is a precondition for the
next (locked by tests/test_capability_bare_building.py):

    live building metrics  →  ontology triples  →  uploaded documents  →  honest "no info"

Building-agnostic: the display name and namespace resolve from the active building's
config/graph, never from a per-building literal. A building with no capability triples and
no documents honestly declines — it does not fabricate.

Survey justification:
  CAPABILITY = 25.6% of corpus (P1); OTHER = 24.0% — together ~50% of queries have no
  grounded path in SPARQL/SQL. Fire Safety (#3 Borda) and Security (#4 Borda) live here.
