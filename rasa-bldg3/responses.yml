  utter_check_air_quality_recommendations:
    - text: "The air quality in your building is within the healthy range according to the Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2.449916 for the last one month. However, it's important to note that while CO levels are still within a healthy range (2.2666666666666666), the NO2 and PM10 levels slightly exceed their respective sensors' standards: 0.085 for NO2 and 0.024 for PM10. It is recommended to monitor these two components closely to maintain optimal air quality. No immediate actions are required at this time, but regular checks and potential adjustments to your building's filtration system may be necessary in the future."
  utter_analyze_recalibration_co2_5_01:
